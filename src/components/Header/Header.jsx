                This project started when I started my studies with Mission Ready. It's a collection of links that
                helped me through my Web Dev Learning journey. I used the project as practice and as a easy access to
                when I need to refresh those concepts.

                I have zero intentions of making any money out of it. But, if by any chance you own the content I have
                here and want it out, don't exitate to contact me and I'll remove it straightaway

        </header>
