# Mission Resources

This repository started as a compilation of resources that I discovered during my learning journey and found valuable. However, as the list continued to grow, I decided to enhance it by giving it a visually appealing web "skin" and incorporating additional notes, such as difficulty level and topic.

Essentially, it is a simple list featuring websites, videos, channels, and links that I personally enjoy. I hope that others can also find value in these resources.

If you are the owner of any of the content listed here and do not wish to be included, please contact me, and I will promptly remove it.
