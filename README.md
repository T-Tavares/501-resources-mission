# Introduction - Mission Resources

This Repo is where I am documenting any resource that makes a difference on my journey as a developer. At this point is just a JS file as a Database where I drop links and info every time I stumble on a channel, video, article, that makes an impact on my learnings.

I've started this repo along with my studies on Mission Ready. And will slowly turn it into a website for easy access and filtering of all the links and channels.

If you're on the list and do not wish to. Please contact me and I'll remove it straight away.
